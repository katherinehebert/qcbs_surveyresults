# Letter of support to the QCBS

The FRQNT (Front de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies) has reduced financial support to the QCBS (Québec Centre for Biodiversity Science) and has requested a justification for the strategic value of the centre, its research, and training. In light of this, we, students, postdoctoral fellows and researchers from a variety of disciplines working in the biodiversity sciences, want to express our strongest support for the QCBS.

The mission of the Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Nature et Technologies (FRQNT) is as follows: 

- *to promote and provide financial support: for research in the fields of natural sciences; for the dissemination of scientific knowledge in fields of research relating to natural sciences; for the training of researchers through scholarships for graduate and postgraduate students*;

- *to create any necessary partnerships, in particular with universities, colleges, and industry and the government departments and public and private bodies concerned*.

        Since its inception 10 years ago, the QCBS has provided a multidisciplinary research pole that has brought together students and researchers from all over Québec, Canada, and abroad. The QCBS plays an essential role in the training of highly qualified personnel in biodiversity sciences through multiple and varied training programs. This has provided unique networking opportunities between graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and researchers internationally recognized in their field and affiliated with the QCBS. The creation of such links is primordial for the establishment of interpersonal and professional relationships between the various researchers and actors in the field of biodiversity sciences.

        The QCBS aims to ensure knowledge sharing and multidisciplinarity in the perspective of biodiversity management and conservation in Québec and abroad. The QCBS offers many training activities, such as working groups, seminars, symposia and various advanced level courses, which are for us, graduate and postdoctoral students, an opportunity to acquire advanced skills in statistics and scientific communication, among many others. The skills developed through the QCBS are fundamental to the pursuit of our academic and professional careers.

        The QCBS is committed to making its training accessible to all and without discrimination. The QCBS provides high-quality education for all by removing financial, linguistic, and mobility barriers that would otherwise prevent a person from having access to it. Equity and diversity is a key focus for the QCBS. Knowledge sharing and training in scientific communication allow students to learn more about the many areas of research encompassed by the field of biodiversity science and the multiple actors in academia, and the public and private sectors of society.

        The QCBS is providing leadership, both nationally and internationally, by bridging the gap between science and policy, and via the application of best practices for biodiversity management and conservation. The collaborations established by the QCBS among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers have created a community, supporting world-class research and training in Québec. A central mission of the QCBS is to train the next generation of biodiversity scientists in Québec and foster the leadership role Québec is providing in Canada and abroad.

        It is for all of the above-mentioned reasons that we urge the strategic cluster program of the FRQNT to continue its funding for the QCBS.
